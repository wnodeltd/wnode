                                You’ve probably felt it, the shift, a tension, a quiet knowing that something fundamental is changing. 
                                We’re entering a new era of human experience where the old structures no longer serve us, and the 
                                familiar ways of creating value are dissolving beneath our feet.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                As AI and robotics take over the mundane, we’re being pushed to redefine meaning, ownership, and opportunity. 
                                The frontrunners in AI all agree on one thing: <span className="text-white font-medium">compute is the new currency.</span>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Those who control it will hold the keys to the vault. And so the race is on for more concrete, more cooling towers, 
                                more mega‑centres rising from the earth. I can almost hear the Mother Earth weeping under the weight of it.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                But the future doesn’t need more scars in the ground or more water‑hungry monoliths. The future is already humming 
                                around us and it is a quiet, ubiquitous planetary hum, a living orchestration of compute that is unused, 
                                unconnected, and spectacularly powerful.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Wnode is the conductor that turns that hum into harmony without uprooting a single acacia tree or evicting 
                                a single creature. Not a bee displaced, not a mole disturbed. Every phone, every EV, every robot, every smart TV, 
                                every IoT device, every server, old or new, is part of a global fabric of compute that is astonishingly vast and wildly underused.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Wnode Mesh isn’t a data centre, a satellite array, or some crypto‑bro hypervisor. It is the connection and 
                                harmonisation of that planetary hum into a living, breathing orchestration of compute that dwarfs the combined 
                                power of the corporate incumbents, and it’s already in your pocket, your home, your office, your car, even the fields.
                            </p>

                            <p className="pt-8 text-white font-medium text-2xl border-t border-white/10">
                                My vision is simple: connect what already exists, empower everyone to participate, and stop wasting the devices 
                                we’ve already paid for with our money and our planet’s resources.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Wnode transforms everyday hardware into income‑generating nodes, giving people real economic agency while 
                                reducing the ecological cost of compute. No more digging. No more water‑hungry cooling. No more landfill cycles.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A truly democratic, community‑owned mesh that is governed by its participants, operated with institutional 
                                stability, and accessible to anyone with a device. This planetary compute layer will power applications we 
                                can’t yet imagine, create revenue streams for millions, and shift control away from centralised giants into 
                                the hands of the people who actually power the network.
